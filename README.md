# Smart-Farm-With-Blynk
this project aims to help farmer maintain their plants or crops by utilizing IOT technology, this technology manages to maintain the sustainablility of plants to use soil moisture sensor to detect dry soil areas and Humidity sensors to detect air humidity and temperature around the plants

# Features
- IoT Integration: The project seamlessly integrates IoT technology to provide real-time data updates via a circular progress bar.
- Manual Control of Water Pump: Users can manually control the water pump, allowing for active management and maintenance of plant growth.
- Optimal Growth Parameters: The project is calibrated based on research on the specific requirements of Perilla plants. This includes maintaining a temperature range of 15-35 degrees Celsius and soil moisture levels between 5-10%.
# Technologies Used
- KiCad: Utilized for creating schematic diagrams for the project.
- Blynk Application: Used to create a simple interface on both the application and website, enabling users to monitor and control the system remotely.


# How It Works
- Research and Parameter Setup: The project begins with research on the plants to be installed, setting up parameters for optimal growth conditions.
- Calibration: The system is calibrated based on the specific requirements of the Perilla plant, ensuring that temperature and soil moisture levels are maintained within the desired ranges.
- Automated Water Pump Control: If the soil moisture drops below the specified threshold (e.g., 5%), the system automatically activates the water pump to provide adequate moisture to the plants.
